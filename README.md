## 🤔 The Problem We're Solving

**AI agents today are powerful but blind:**

- ❌ Can't see what code actually does when it runs
- ❌ Can't capture your screen or record demonstrations
- ❌ Can't manage files beyond basic read/write
- ❌ Can't control processes or applications
- ❌ Can't interact with your actual development environment

**Result:** You're stuck doing manual work that AI should handle.

#### 🔥 What This Changes

**Before:** AI worked blind, relying on code descriptions

- ❌ "The layout looks broken" → AI guesses what's wrong
- ❌ "Create documentation" → AI writes generic text without visuals
- ❌ "Check accessibility" → AI can only review code, not actual contrast
- ❌ "Debug responsive design" → AI can't see actual breakpoint behavior

**After:** AI sees and analyzes your actual user interface

- ✅ **Visual debugging** - AI identifies exact pixel-level issues
- ✅ **Intelligent documentation** - AI creates guides with real screenshots and annotations
- ✅ **Accessibility audits** - AI measures actual contrast ratios and spacing
- ✅ **Responsive testing** - AI captures and compares different screen sizes
- ✅ **Design analysis** - AI evaluates visual hierarchy and user experience
- ✅ **Professional bug reports** - AI creates detailed reports with visual evidence

**✨ Now available on NPM, Docker Hub, and VS Code Marketplace!**

**The Problem:** AI agents couldn't safely manage system processes. They needed to run commands, monitor resources, and manage services, but without proper security boundaries, this posed significant risks—command injection, resource exhaustion, and privilege escalation.

**The Solution:** AI agents now have **enterprise-grade process management** with 6 layers of security validation. From launching processes with resource limits to managing long-running services with auto-restart, AI can now safely orchestrate your development environment.

#### 🔥 Key Features

**Process Management:**

- **Process launching** with arguments and environment variables
- **Resource monitoring** - Track CPU, memory, threads, and I/O in real-time
- **Output capture** - Separate stdout and stderr streams
- **Process termination** - Graceful (SIGTERM) and forced (SIGKILL) with timeout escalation
- **Interactive processes** - Send stdin input and retrieve buffered output
- **Timeout management** - Automatic termination after specified duration

**Service Management:**

- **Long-running services** with auto-restart capabilities
- **Health checks** - Periodic validation of service health
- **Restart policies** - Configurable retry limits and backoff strategies
- **Service lifecycle** - Start, stop, restart, and monitor services

**Process Groups:**

- **Group management** - Organize related processes
- **Pipeline creation** - Chain processes with stdout/stdin piping
- **Batch operations** - Terminate entire groups at once

**Security (Defense-in-Depth):**

#### 🔒 Enterprise Security

**6 Layers of Security Validation:**

1. **Executable Allowlist** - Only approved executables can be launched

   - Supports absolute paths, basenames, and glob patterns
   - Blocks shell interpreters by default (bash, sh, cmd.exe)
   - Prevents setuid executable execution

2. **Argument Validation** - Prevents command injection

   - Validates all command-line arguments
   - Blocks shell metacharacters and injection patterns
   - Sanitizes special characters

3. **Environment Sanitization** - Removes dangerous variables

   - Strips LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   - Removes privilege escalation vectors
   - Validates environment variable names and values

4. **Resource Limits** - Prevents resource exhaustion

   - CPU percentage limits (per-process)
   - Memory limits (MB)
   - CPU time limits (seconds)
   - Automatic termination on limit exceeded

5. **Privilege Prevention** - No privilege escalation

   - Blocks sudo, su, pkexec
   - Prevents setuid executable execution
   - Enforces least-privilege principle

6. **Audit Logging** - Complete operation tracking
   - Logs all process operations
   - Records security violations
   - Tracks resource usage
   - Compliance-ready audit trail

#### 📊 Quality Metrics

- **Comprehensive testing** with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Security-first design** with defense-in-depth validation
- **Production-ready** with graceful error handling
- **Cross-platform** support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Docker deployment** with secure defaults

## 🔧 Kiro MCP Configuration

### Quick Setup for Kiro Users

Configure Kiro to use the AI Capability Extension Suite MCP servers by editing `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-screenshot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ai-capabilities-suite/mcp-screenshot"]
    },
    "mcp-process": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@ai-capabilities-suite/mcp-process",
        "--config",
        "./mcp-process-config.json"
      ]
    },
    "mcp-debugger": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ai-capabilities-suite/mcp-debugger-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Process Configuration

Create `mcp-process-config.json` in your project directory or home directory:

```json
{
  "allowedExecutables": ["node", "python3", "npm", "yarn", "git"],
  "defaultResourceLimits": {
    "maxCpuPercent": 80,
    "maxMemoryMB": 1024,
    "maxCpuTime": 300
  },
  "maxConcurrentProcesses": 10,
  "maxProcessLifetime": 3600,
  "enableAuditLog": true,
  "blockShellInterpreters": true,
  "blockSetuidExecutables": true,
  "allowProcessTermination": true,
  "allowForcedTermination": false
}
```

> **Note:** The config file requirement for mcp-process will be removed in an upcoming release, making it optional with sensible defaults.

### Prerequisites

**For Linux users (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
# Install Python setuptools for native dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y python3-setuptools build-essential
```

**For macOS users:**

```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

**For Windows users:**

```powershell
# Install Visual Studio Build Tools
# Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
```

### Alternative: Global Installation

If you prefer global installation over npx:

```bash
# Install all three servers globally
npm install -g @ai-capabilities-suite/mcp-screenshot
npm install -g @ai-capabilities-suite/mcp-process
npm install -g @ai-capabilities-suite/mcp-debugger-server

# Then use direct commands in mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-screenshot": {
      "command": "mcp-screenshot"
    },
    "mcp-process": {
      "command": "mcp-process",
      "args": ["--config", "./mcp-process-config.json"]
    },
    "mcp-debugger": {
      "command": "mcp-debugger"
    }
  }
}
```

### Verification

After configuration, restart Kiro and verify the servers are connected:

```
You: "List available MCP tools"
Kiro: *Shows tools from mcp-screenshot, mcp-process, and mcp-debugger*
```

### Troubleshooting

**Connection issues:**
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Check Python setuptools: `python3 -c "import setuptools"`
- Verify packages are published: `npm view @ai-capabilities-suite/mcp-screenshot`

**Native dependency errors:**
- Install build tools (see Prerequisites above)
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Reinstall with: `npm install -g --force @ai-capabilities-suite/mcp-screenshot`

**Config file not found:**
- Use absolute path to config file in mcp.json
- Verify file exists: `ls -la ./mcp-process-config.json`
- Check JSON syntax: `cat mcp-process-config.json | jq`
